### üõ† Tools & libraries Used.

Here is a list of the libraries contained in the package.json and the reasons why I installed each of them.

#### React JS

- I used react JS so I'lld be able to seamlessly craft the UI for the datepicker.
- React also helped me create **_reusable components_**.

#### Typescript

- Typescript provides static typing (duck typing actually) superpowers to my javascript.
- The test is testing for my ability to utilize typescript so using typescript was important.

#### StoryBook

I made use of storybook because:

- I needed to build Pickr in isolation as an independed component.
- I was required to provide this **_documentation_** with it.

#### Emotion

I picked Emotion as my choice for **_styling_** for the following reasons:

- Emotion integrates seamlessly with StoryBook.
- Emotion provides access to component props when writing styles.
- Emotion lets me use conditionals and javascript functions in my stylesheet. One that I particularly like is a function I used to auto convert px units to rem. This function saved me all the time I would have spent manually dividing px values from figma by 16.

#### Tsconfig Paths (Webpack Plugin)

- I had to make use of this plugin package because storybook doesn't pick up baseUrl and paths configurations from the default tsconfig file. I was fine with that as I could use relative imports but I thought about it once more and decided I preferred absolute imports to keep my import paths short, precise and consistent across separate folders.
