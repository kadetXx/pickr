### üõ† Tools & libraries Used.

Here is a list of the libraries contained in the package.json and the reasons why I installed each of them.

#### React JS

- I used react JS so I'lld be able to seamlessly craft the UI for the datepicker.
- React helped me create **_reusable components_**.

#### Typescript

- Typescript provides static typing (duck typing actually) superpowers to my javascript.
- The test is testing for my ability to utilize typescript so using typescript was important.

#### StoryBook

I had to make use of storybook because:

- I needed to build Pickr in isolation as an independed component.
- I was required to provide this **_documentation_** with it.

#### Emotion

I picked Emotion as my choice for styling for the following reasons:

- Emotion integrates seamlessly with StoryBook.
- Emotion provides access to component props when writing styles.
- Emotion lets me use conditionals and javascript functions in my stylesheet. One that I particularly like is a function I wrote to convert px units to rem. Rem units is a neccessity when I am building responsive components and this function saved me all the time I would have used to manually divide px values from figma by 16.
- And lastly, [FloatHQ](https://float.co) already uses emotion on the web app so I thought it'll be an impressive choice.
